# CI/CD with GitHub Actions â€“ Starter

[![Build Status](https://github.com/<YOUR_USER>/<YOUR_REPO>/actions/workflows/ci.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/<YOUR_USER>/<YOUR_REPO>/actions/workflows/ci.yml)

A minimal CI/CD example that runs on every push and pull request:
- Build the project
- Run unit tests
- Run a quick quality check (lint or basic security scan)
- Show results as PR checks and a status badge

> **Goal:** prove you understand CI basics end-to-end with a clean, reproducible repo.
